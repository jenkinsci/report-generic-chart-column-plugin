<div>
	This allows you to specify a mathematical expression which, if true, will turn the job to unstbale<br/>
	First the  expression is split by |(or) and &(and)<br/>
	Then it it is split by &gt;,&lt;, ==, !=, <=, >= <br/>
	each of the remaining parts is calcualted as mathematical expression. as powerfull as https://github.com/gbenroscience/ParserNG, with few extensions:<br/>
	you can use L0 to access value of just finished build. L1 as value of last one before, L2 as two before and so on...Negative id on L is not allowed nowhere<br/>
	points in chart chart with 4 bullets, wehich fifth build jsut finished  would be L4 L3 L2 L1 L0<br/>
	you can use ranges by `..`. Eg ..L1 is all before L0 (thus Ln...L2,L1). Similarly, L3.. would be L3,L2,L1. You can use also both limits - eg: L1..L3  o<br/>
	On top of functions in ParseNG, geom, gsum and count functions are provided and available (are being upstreamed, but waiting for upstream release)<br/>
	<blockquote>
		Expression : avg(..L1)*1.1 <  L0 | L1*1.3 <  L0<br/>
		Upon       : 60,20,80,70<br/>
		As         : Ln...L1,L0<br/>
		Expanded as: avg(60,20,80)*1.1 <  70 | 80*1.3 <  70
		<blockquote>
			evaluating: avg(60,20,80)*1.1 <  70 | 80*1.3 <  70
			<blockquote>
				evaluating: avg(60,20,80)*1.1 <  70
				<blockquote>
					evaluating: avg(60,20,80)*1.1<br/>
					is: 58.66666666666667<br/>
					evaluating: 70<br/>
					is: 70
				</blockquote>
				... 58.66666666666667 < 70<br/>
				is: true<br/>
				evaluating: 80*1.3 <  70
				<blockquote>
					evaluating: 80*1.3<br/>
					is: 104.0<br/>
					evaluating: 70<br/>
					is: 70
				</blockquote>
				... 104.0 < 70<br/>
				is: false

			... true | false<br/>
			is: true

		is: true
	</blockquote>
	TRUE , thus job WILL be turned to unstable<br/>
	Max number in L (and thus also in functions) is 99<br/>
	The parser is far from being perfect, be nice to it.<br/>
	The brackets are avialable onmly iside math expressions. The Logical part is only sequential<br/>
